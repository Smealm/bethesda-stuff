bethesda scripts or whatever i end up putting here

run.bat is for Script Extenders. if the script extender is present, launching the game from steam launches the game through the Script Extender, if the Script Extender is not present it launches the game through its official launcher.

in the SkyrimSE Folder, download run.bat and put it into \steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\
open up steam and right click on skyrim, go to properties, launch options and put `run.bat %command%` into it.
the same setup with Fallout 4 but use the run.bat from the Fallout 4 Folder
